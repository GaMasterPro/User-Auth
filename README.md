Tkinter Login and Sign-Up Application
This project is a simple GUI-based Login and Sign-Up application built using Python's Tkinter library. The application allows users to log in or sign up by providing their username, password, and email address. User credentials are validated, and feedback is provided through message boxes.

Features
Login Screen: Users can enter their username and password to log in.
Sign-Up Window: New users can sign up by providing a username, password, and email.
Email Validation: The email address provided during sign-up is validated to ensure it contains an '@' symbol.
User Feedback: Message boxes provide feedback for successful or unsuccessful login and sign-up attempts.
Stylized Entry Fields: Custom styling applied to entry fields to enhance user experience.

Customization
Style Entry Fields: You can modify the style_entry function in app.py to change the appearance of the entry fields.
User Validation Logic: The user validation and addition logic is handled in the check_credentials.py module. You can customize the validation or storage mechanisms as needed


Future Enhancements
Persistent User Storage: Currently, the user data handling is assumed to be managed by the check_credentials module. You might consider storing user data in a JSON file or a database for persistence.
Password Recovery: Implement a password recovery feature to help users reset forgotten passwords.
User Profile Management: Add functionality for users to update their profiles, including changing passwords and email addresses.
